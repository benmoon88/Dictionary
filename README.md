# Dictionary
 
This is a simple CLI program that reads a specifically formatted text document containing a dictionary of words, descriptions and word types.
The rest of the program will perform basic tasks to maniplulate the information.
The program also has a simple guessing game and word generator (using trigrams).

This program was developed for a University assignment for Object Oriented Programming in C++.
DO NOT Copy code if you're using for a similar assignment.

# Use of Dictionary
Simple CLI interface, using a basic menu system to navigate, should not crash.
Any feedback to improve the program is welcome.

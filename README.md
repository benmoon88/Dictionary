# Dictionary
 
This is a simple CLI program that reads a specifically formatted text document containig a dictionary of words, descriptions and word types.
The rest of the program will perform basic tasks to maniplulate the information
The program also has a simple guessing game and word generator (using trigrams)

This program was developed for a University assignment for Object Oriented Programming in C++

# Use of Dictionary
Simple CLI interface, using a basic menu system to navigate, should not crash.
Any feedback to improve the program is welcome
